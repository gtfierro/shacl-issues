# shacl-issues

Documenting issues with SHACL and variations in SHACL output.

## Structure

- `/ontologies/`: a folder for each ontology referenced in the repo; folder should also contain all of the dependencies for the ontology
- `/scripts/`: supplementary tools for interacting with ontologies and other parts of the repo:
    - `./scripts/update_ontologies.sh`: run this to update the local cache of all ontologies
